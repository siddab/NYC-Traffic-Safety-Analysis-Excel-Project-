# ðŸš¦ NYC Traffic Safety Analysis (Excel Project)

Analyzed NYC motor vehicle collision data (Jan 2021 â€“ Apr 2023) to uncover seasonal trends, time-of-week hotspots, and contributing factors using Excel tools like pivot tables, line charts, heatmaps, and conditional formatting.

- Counted collisions by month and year
- Built a multi-line chart comparing seasonal trends across 2021â€“2023
- Excluded partial data from April 2023 for clean visuals

### 2. Weekly Trends
